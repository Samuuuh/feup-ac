## Matplotlib

- basic
  - [X] plot (function line in plane)
  - [ ] scatter (points in plane)
  - [X] bar
  - [ ] stem (almost the same as bars, but with lines)
  - [ ] step (almost the same as plot, but with steps)
  - [ ] fill_between (paints a plane between two functions)
- statistics
  - [X] hist
  - [ ] boxplot
  - [ ] errorbar (points with margin of error displayed)
  - [ ] violinplot
  - [ ] eventplot (lines representing events)
  - [ ] hist2d (2D histogram)
  - [ ] hexbin (simillar to hitogram but for real-domain variables (?))
  - [X] pie
- Plots of arrays and fields
    - [ ] imshow
    - [ ] pcolormesh
    - [ ] contour
    - [ ] countourf (same as contour, but with colored lines)
    - [ ] barbs
    - [ ] quiver (gradient function)
    - [ ] stramplot (seems to be like quiver, but with the gradients being followed entirelly)
- countours (I don't know if they are useful, but they are complex)
