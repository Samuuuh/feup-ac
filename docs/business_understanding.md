# Business Understanding

## Business Goals

The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning application that predicts if a loan will default or not.

## Requirements Analysis

### User Stories

The application has only one actor, the *User* that can do all the following operations:

- Train models using the selected configurations,
  so that the *User* can choose the models that are going to be used for the other operations

- Compare the scoring of the results of models, 
  so that the *User* can verify the differences of the models and understand the capabilities of each one of them

- Calculate the area under the curve score for the models,
  so that the *User* can use an objective scoring method to compare all the models

- Use a specific model configuration to predict default results of a dataset,
  so that the *User* can use a chosen model to predict missing default attributes for loans

### Other Requirements

The system should satisfy the following requirements:

- The application should provide a simple and easy to use CLI interface,
  so people can use it regardless of their programming knowledge

- The project needs to be done before its deadline,
  so that all the desired features are implemented and used in the evaluation of the project
